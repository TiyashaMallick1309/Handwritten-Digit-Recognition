# Digit-Recognition

Welcome to our Digit Recognition App built with Streamlit! <br/>
This app uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network to recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9.<br/> Simply draw a digit on the canvas provided, and the app will predict the number you wrote.<br/> It's a fun and interactive way to explore the capabilities of machine learning, and we hope you enjoy using it!

## Features
* Drawable canvas for digit recognition
* Real-time prediction of drawn digit
* User-friendly interface
* Ability to clear canvas and redraw
* Integration with machine learning model


## Requirements
Before running this project, you must have the following installed:

- Python 3<br/>
- TensorFlow<br/>
- NumPy<br/>
- Matplotlib<br/>
- OpenCV<br/>
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)<br/>
- Streamlit<br/>

## Model Training
The model was trained on the MNIST dataset using a deep neural network architecture, resulting in the creation of the 'final.h5' model file.<br/>
The model uses a convolutional neural network architecture with two convolutional layers, max pooling layers, and a dropout layer to prevent overfitting.<br/> The model achieved an accuracy of 99.05% on the test set.
